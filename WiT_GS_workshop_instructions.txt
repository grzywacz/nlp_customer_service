Common Steps Across All Platforms

1. Ensure Python & pip are installed;
   Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run:

   python --version
   pip --version

   This checks the version of Python and pip (Python's package installer) to ensure they are installed. If these commands fail, Python or pip may need to be installed or fixed.

   1.1 If Python or pip are not installed:
      
      Installing Python

      Windows

      Download the Python Installer:
      - Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
      - Download the latest Python installer for Windows (make sure to select the option that matches your architecture, such as 64-bit or 32-bit).

      Run the Installer:
      - Open the downloaded file to start the installation.
      - Important: Ensure you check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” at the beginning of the installation process.
      - Click on “Install Now” and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

      Verify Installation:
      - Open Command Prompt (`Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter).
      - Type `python --version` and `pip --version` to confirm that Python and pip are installed correctly.

      Linux

      Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. However, it may not be the latest version, and pip might need to be installed separately.

      Install Python:
      - Open a terminal window.
      - For Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, use:

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

      - For Red Hat-based distributions like Fedora, use:

        sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip


      Verify Installation:
      - Check Python and pip versions:
    
        python3 --version
        pip3 --version

      macOS

      macOS typically comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed, but for development, Python 3.x is recommended.

      Install Python via Homebrew (a package manager for macOS):
      - First, install Homebrew by pasting the following command in a Terminal window (find Terminal in Applications/Utilities):
     
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     
      - After installing Homebrew, install Python 3:
     
     brew install python

      Verify Installation**:
      - In the Terminal, type:

     python3 --version
     pip3 --version


2. Install Jupyter Notebook:
   It's recommended to install Jupyter globally to avoid issues with virtual environment paths, especially on Windows. Run:
   
   pip install notebook


Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Windows

1. Open Command Prompt:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

2. Create a Virtual Environment:
   - Navigate to your project directory:
 
     cd path\to\your\project

   - Create a virtual environment named `env`:

     python -m venv env

3. Activate the Virtual Environment:

   .\env\Scripts\activate

4. Install Required Packages:
   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(env)` before the command prompt).
   - Install any required packages using pip. For example:

     pip install numpy pandas matplotlib


5. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook


Linux / macOS

1. Open a Terminal Window:
   - You can typically find this in your applications menu or utilities folder.

2. Create a Virtual Environment:
   - Navigate to your project directory:

     cd path/to/your/project

   - Create a virtual environment named `env`:

     python3 -m venv env


3. Activate the Virtual Environment:

   source env/bin/activate


4. Install Required Packages:
   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(env)` before the command prompt).
   - Install any required packages using pip. For example:

     pip install numpy pandas matplotlib


5. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook
 
General Notes

- Deactivating the Virtual Environment: 
   To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your system’s default Python interpreter, simply run:

  deactivate

- Managing Packages: If you need additional Python packages, install them while the virtual environment is activated using `pip install requirements.txt`.
- Accessing Notebooks: Jupyter Notebook will start in your default browser. You can create new notebooks or open existing ones from the directory you started Jupyter in.
